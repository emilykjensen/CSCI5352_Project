# Description of uploaded figures
- avg-video-views-monthly.png : Average number of video views per student according to month. For example, each student watches an average of 5 videos in January.
- student-degree.png : Distribution of student degrees in the bipartite graph. This represents the number of unique videos a student has watched over the semester.
- video-degree.png : Distribution of video degrees in the bipartite graph. This represents the number of unique students that have watched a particular video
- video-proj-degree.png : Distribution of degrees of 1-mode video projection. This represents the number of neighbors (videos the same student has watched)
- video-vews-monthly.png : Distribution of video views across the semester
- between-centrality-video.png : Distribution of betweenness centrality measures for the projected video network.
- close-centrality-video.png : Distribution of closeness centrality measures for the projected video network.
- cluster-coefficient-video.png : Distribution of clustering coefficient measures for the projected video network.
- deg-centrality-video.png : Distribution of degree centrality measures for the projected video network.
- eig-centrality-video.png : Distribution of eigenvector centrality measures for the projected video network.
- video-avg-month.png - Dustribution of the average month in which each video was viewed.
- video-first-view.png - Count of videos first viewed in each month.
